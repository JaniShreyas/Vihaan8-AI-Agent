The page is a login page for a vulnerable API called crAPI designed for security training.  I initially attempted to click the "Signup" element using `link_text`, which failed because the element was a button, not a link.  I successfully clicked the "Signup" button by using `class_name` "ant-btn-default"  because this class was common to both the Login and Signup buttons, and I happened to click the Signup button first.  This action took me to a signup page.
