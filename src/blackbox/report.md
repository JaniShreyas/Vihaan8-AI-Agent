I observed two buttons in the header ("Login" and "Signup") and three in the login form ("Forgot Password?", "Login", and "Don't have an account? Signup").  I attempted to click the "Login" button in the form using its primary class name. This resulted in a successful redirection to a login page (http://localhost:8888/login). Attempting to click "Signup" using its class name resulted in an unintended redirect back to the main login page.  A more complete analysis is needed to understand the full functionality of the application, including the expected behavior of each button and the handling of inputs.  The current actions provide a partial understanding of the page's behavior and a limited interaction with its elements. The full page content is shown in previous observations.
