The initial page contained a login form with "Login" and "Signup" buttons in the navigation bar, and "Login" and "Forgot Password?" buttons within the login form itself.  The "Forgot Password?" button was clicked successfully using the class name "alternative-style" as a locator, resulting in navigation to the forgot password page.  This was the most appropriate action because it explored a key feature of the website.  The failure of the first attempt highlights the importance of selecting the correct locator strategy when interacting with web elements.
